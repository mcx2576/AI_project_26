1. Maturation of polycistronic mRNA by RNase Y and its associated Y-complex in Gram-positive bacteria
(Submitter supplied) Endonucleolytic cleavage within polycistronic mRNAs can lead to differential stability and discordant abundance among co-transcribed genes. RNase Y, the major endonuclease for mRNA decay in Bacillus subtilis, was originally identified for its cleavage activity towards the cggR-gapA operon, an event that differentiates the expression of a glycolytic enzyme from its transcriptional regulator. A three-protein Y-complex (YlbF, YmcA, and YaaT) was recently identified that is also required for this cleavage in vivo, raising the possibility that it is an accessory factor acting to regulate RNase Y. more...

3. The cold shock response of Bacillus subtilis analyzed by RNA-sequencing: YplP regulates pyruvate transport at low temperatures
(Submitter supplied) The cold shock response of B. subtilis was defined after 0.5 hr and 2 hr cold shock using RNA sequencing. We identified novel RNAs (including non-coding RNAs) that play a role during growth at low temperatures. Deletion of the cold induced protein YplP results in a cold sensitive phenotype, and a comparative RNA sequencing analysis suggests that YplP induces pftAB expression after prolonged incubation at low temperatures, thereby optimizing pyruvate transport under cold shock conditions.

An extreme type of heterogeneity is the so-called bistable or bimodal expression, whereby a cell can differentiate into two alternative expression states, and consequently a population will be composed of cells that are ‘ON’ and cells that are ‘OFF’. Stochastic fluctuations of protein levels, also referred to as noise, provide the necessary source of heterogeneity that must be amplified by autostimulatory feedback regulation to obtain the bimodal response. more...

Gene-level intensities were scaled based on the intensity values of 10 spike-in transcripts. This approach allowed to determine the total mRNA fraction out of the total RNA pool. The data revealed that the proportion of total mRNA in total RNA remained constant across samples which implies that total mRNA abundance in B. more...

35. C.glutamicum Δpup mutant senses a stronger iron limitation than the wild type.
(Submitter supplied) Pupylation is a posttranslational protein modification in bacteria resembling ubiquitination in eukaryotes. The prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein Pup is covalently attached to other proteins via an isopeptide bond between its carboxyterminal glutamate residue and a lysine residue in the target. In mycobacteria, pupylation was shown to mark proteins for unfolding by the ATPase Mpa and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. more...

36. Engineering Corynebacterium glutamicum for fast production of lysine and pipecolic acid
(Submitter supplied) The Gram-positive soil bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum is widely used in industrial fermentative processes for the production of amino acids. The world production of L-lysine has surpassed 2 million tons per year. Glucose is taken up into the C. glutamicum cell by the phosphotransferase system PTS which can be replaced and/or enhanced by a permease and a glucokinase. Heterologous expression of the gene for the high-affinity glucose permease from Streptomyces coelicolor and of the Bacillus subitilis glucokinase gene fully compensated for the absence of the PTS in hpr strains and strains grew as fast with glucose as C. more...

37. A Comprehensive, CRISPR-based Approach to Functional Analysis of Essential Genes in Bacteria
(Submitter supplied) Essential gene products underpin the core reactions required for cell viability, but are poorly studied in vivo due to a shortage of appropriate technologies. Using CRISPR interference, we created knockdowns of every essential gene in Bacillus subtilis and probed their phenotypes. Our high-confidence essential gene network, established using chemical genomics, showed extensive interconnections among distantly related processes and identified the modes of action for uncharacterized antibiotics. more...

38. Control of Smc Coiled Coil Architecture by the ATPase Heads Facilitates Targeting to Chromosomal ParB/parS and Release onto Flanking DNA
(Submitter supplied) Smc/ScpAB promotes chromosome segregation in prokaryotes, presumably by compacting and resolving nascent sister chromosomes. The underlying mechanisms, however, are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of the Smc ATPase activity in the recruitment of Smc/ScpAB to the Bacillus subtilis chromosome. We demonstrate that targeting of Smc/ScpAB to ParB/parS loading sites is strictly dependent on engagement of Smc head domains and relies on an open organization of the Smc coiled coils. more...

40. The Epigenomic Landscape of Prokaryotes
(Submitter supplied) DNA methylation is an important regulator of genome function in the eukaryotes, but it is currently unclear if the same is true in prokaryotes. While regulatory functions have been demonstrated for a small number of bacteria, there have been no large-scale studies of prokaryotic methylomes and the full repertoire of targets and biological functions of DNA methylation remains unclear. Here we applied single-molecule, real-time sequencing to directly study the methylomes of 232 phylogenetically diverse prokaryotes. more...

The role of sigF is well studied under conditions that induce sporulation. Here, the impact of a sigF disruption on the transcriptome of exponentially growing cultures is studied by micro-array analysis. This is relevant because in various experiments, such as industrial fermentation, prolonged experimental evolution or zero-growth studies, sporulation is an undesirable trait that should be avoided, e.g by a sigF mutation. more...

52. Condensin promotes the juxtaposition of DNA flanking its loading site in Bacillus subtilis
(Submitter supplied) SMC condensin complexes play a central role in compacting and resolving replicated chromosomes in virtually all organisms yet how they accomplish this remains elusive. In Bacillus subtilis, condensin is loaded at centromeric parS sites, where it encircles DNA and individualizes newly replicated origins. Using chromosome conformation capture and cytological assays, we show that condensin recruitment to origin-proximal parS sites is required for the juxtaposition of the two chromosome arms. more...

92. IpsA, a novel transcriptional regulator required for inositol derived lipid formation in Corynebacteria and Mycobacteria
(Submitter supplied) The development of new drugs against tuberculosis and diphtheria is focused on disrupting the biogenesis of the cell wall, the unique architecture of which confers resistance against current therapies. The enzymatic pathways involved in the synthesis of the cell wall by these pathogens are well understood but the underlying regulatory mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we characterize IpsA, a LacI-type transcriptional regulator conserved among Mycobacteria and Corynebacteria that plays a role in the regulation of cell wall biogenesis. more...

(Submitter supplied) The nucleotide (p)ppGpp is crucial for viability during amino acid limitation in bacteria, yet how it accomplishes this remains unknown. We found that the absence of (p)ppGpp in Bacillus subtilis cells leads to multiple amino acid auxotrophy, and that (p)ppGpp allows for prototrophy by reducing GTP levels. We provide evidence that reduction of GTP levels relieves the requirements for branched-chain amino acids primarily by preventing hyperactivity of the GTP-dependent transcriptional regulator CodY, but that GTP levels can also play an important role in regulating transcription of many amino acid biosynthesis genes independently of CodY. more...

We detected 121 arginine phospho-sites for 87 proteins in the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis in vivo. Moreover, we provide evidences that arginine phosphorylations are involved in the fine-tuned signal transduction of many critical cellular processes, such as protein degradation, motility, competence, stringent and stress response. more...

128. The anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence drives translational pausing and codon choice in bacteria
(Submitter supplied) Protein synthesis by ribosomes takes place on a linear substrate but at variable speeds. Transient pausing of ribosomes can impact a variety of co-translational processes, including protein targeting and folding. These pauses are influenced by the sequence of the mRNA. Thus redundancy in the genetic code allows the same protein to be translated at different rates. However, our knowledge of both the position and the mechanism of translational pausing in vivo is highly limited. more...

168. Bacillus subtilis 168, WT  vs. ΔMWX, WT vs. Δ7ECF, Δ7ECF vs. ΔMWX.
(Submitter supplied) Bacillus subtilis encodes seven extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors. Three (sigma M, sigma W and simga X) mediate responses to cell envelope active antibiotics. The functions of sigma Y, sigma Z, sigma V, and YlaC remain largely unknown, and strong inducers of these sigma factors and their regulons have yet to be defined. Here, we define transcriptomic and phenotypic differences under non-stress conditions between strains carrying deletions in all seven ECF sigma factor genes (Δ7ECF), a  sigMWX triple mutant (∆MWX), and the parental 168 strain. more...

Analyses of the control and overproducing strains were carried out at the end of exponential growth and in stationary phase, when protein secretion from B. subtilis is optimal. Among the genes that showed increased expression were htrA and htrB, which are part of the CssRS regulon that responds to high-level protein secretion and heat stress. more...

206. Gene expression during Bacillus subtilis spore germination and outgrowth (t=0-100)
(Submitter supplied) Bacillus subtilis forms dormant spores upon nutrient depletion. Under favorable environmental conditions, the spore breaks its dormancy and resumes growth in a process called spore germination and outgrowth. To elucidate the physiological processes that occur during the transition of the dormant spore to an actively growing vegetative cell, we studied this process in a time-dependent manner by a combination of microscopy, analysis of extracellular metabolites and a genome-wide analysis of transcription. more...

207. Comparison of gene expression in spo0J mutant and wild-type B. subtilis
(Submitter supplied) We investigated the genome-wide DNA binding of the chromosome partitioning and sporulation protein and ParB family member Spo0J in Bacillus subtilis using chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA microarrays.  We identified ten parS loci to which Spo0J binds, two of which were unexpectedly distant (>1 Mb) from the origin of replication.  We used all ten sites to refine the consensus sequence for parS.  We found that Spo0J spreads along the DNA around each site.  Binding was near maximal levels up to 1.6 kb away from parS, and significantly above background as far away as 18 kb.  Deletion of soj (parA) had no detectable effect on spreading.  In contrast, the spo0J93 allele appeared to cause a significant decrease in spreading in vivo, without significantly affecting the DNA binding affinity in vitro.  spo0J93 causes a phenotype similar to that of a spo0J null mutant and alters the region thought to be involved in interaction between Spo0J dimers.  Our findings indicate that spreading is important for in vivo function of Spo0J.  Gene expression in areas near parS sites was similar in wild-type and a spo0J null mutant, indicating that binding and spreading of Spo0J on DNA does not silence transcription of nearby genes.

209. Interference of PrfA with glucose uptake
(Submitter supplied) Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) strains expressing high levels of the virulence regulator PrfA (mutant PrfA* or wild-type PrfA) show strong growth inhibition in minimal media when supplemented with glucose but not when supplemented with glucose-6-phosphate compared to the isogenic strains expressing low levels of PrfA. A significantly reduced rate of glucose uptake is observed in the PrfA* over-expressing strain growing in LB supplemented with glucose. more...

211. Analysis of the transcriptional response to DNA damage and replication arrest
(Submitter supplied) Our results indicate that the transcriptional responses to HPUra, MMC, and UV are only partially overlapping. recA is the major transcriptional regulator under all of the tested conditions and LexA appears to directly repress expression of 63 genes in 26 operons, including the 18 operons previously identified as LexA targets.  MMC and HPUra treatments caused induction of an integrative and conjugative element (ICEBs1) and resident prophages (PBSX and SPß), which affected expression of many host genes. more...

213. Listeria host responses
(Submitter supplied) This logical set encompases several 8hr timecourses (0,1,2,4,8 hrs) and their replicates.  All correspond to treatments of bone marrow derived macrophages. Abstract: Innate and adaptive immunity depends critically on host recognition of pathogen-associated molecules. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key mediators of pathogen surveillance at the cell or phagocytic vacuole surface. However, mechanisms underlying recognition of pathogens in other cellular compartments remain unclear, and responses elicited by cytosolic challenge are poorly characterized. more...

214. Genome-wide transcriptional analysis of the phosphate starvation stimulon of Bacillus subtilis
(Submitter supplied) Bacillus subtilis responds to phosphate starvation stress by inducing the PhoP and SigB regulons. While the PhoP regulon provides a specific response to phosphate starvation stress, maximizing the acquisition of phosphate (Pi) from the environment and reducing the cellular requirement for this essential nutrient, the SigB regulon provide non-specific resistance to stress by protecting essential cellular components such as DNA and membranes. more...

216. Bacillus Stress Responses
(Submitter supplied) Bacillus subtilis exhibits a complex adaptive response to low levels of peroxides. We used global transcriptional profiling to monitor the magnitude and kinetics of changes in the mRNA population after exposure to either hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or tert-butyl peroxide (t-buOOH). The peroxide stimulons could be largely accounted for by three regulons controlled by the PerR, B, and OhrR transcription factors. more...
